          <p>
            I am a curious and driven individual who enjoys learning new things and taking on challenges. 
            In my free time, I enjoy exploring technology, solving puzzles, and working on creative projects. <br /><br />
            One of my goals is to become a well-rounded developer, and to support that, Iâ€™ve been dedicating time to learning new programming languages and building personal projects. This mindset keeps me motivated and focused on continuous improvement.
